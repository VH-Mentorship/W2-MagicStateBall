# VH Mentorship Workshop 1 Take-Home #3: Magic State Ball

## Overview

This take-home will give you practice with React through a fun and simple project. Additionally, the types of challenges you will be encountering here are actually **very similar** to React coding assessments that you might get when applying to front-end roles.

## Challenges
Following instructions is good and all, but very unlike what you'll be doing as a real developer. Complete these challenges, make this 8-ball your own, and show it off to friends and in the `mentee-works` Discord channel! (TIP: Make Google searching your best friend)

1. **Modularize your code:** That answerArray is over 100 characters, Yuck ðŸ¤¢. Let's hide it in another file. Figure out how to put answerArray in its own file, export it, and import it into `App.js`!
2. **More with states:** Having a bad day? Create a [checkbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) that, when checked, will only let the 8-ball return positive phrases (i.e. "It is certain", "without a doubt"). You will need to create a new function to handle this, and make good friends with Stack Overflow and the documentation.
3. **What next?** Anything you want! Make the ball shake when you click it with CSS animations, add functionality for a space bar, create a "leaderboard" of results based on how often they show up... Reach out to your pod leaders or in `mentee-works` for advice!
